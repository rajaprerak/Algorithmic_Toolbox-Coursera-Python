#### Divide and Conquer Strategy
* We have a problem. We divide that problem into subproblems. This subproblems are similar type as original problem.
* We recursively solve each subproblem using same strategy.
* Combine the results.
#### Binary Search 
* The worst case time complexity of binary search is O(log N)
