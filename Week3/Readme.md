### Greedy Algorithms

* Make a greedy choice and reduction to subproblem.
* We have to make sure our greedy choice is a safe move.
* Subproblem is problem with same king but having fewer parameters.

#### Safe Moves:

* Put max digit first
* Find first occurence of first character
* Cover leftmost point
* Use item with max value per unit of weight

> Greedy Problems can be faster after sorting.
